# Final Course Assessment

## Test Your Knowledge

Congratulations on completing the **Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics** curriculum. This final assessment covers concepts from ROS 2, Simulation, NVIDIA Isaac, and Generative AI.

<Quiz questions={[
  {
    question: "Module 1: Which ROS 2 communication pattern is best suited for a task that takes a long time to complete (e.g., 'Navigate to Kitchen') and requires feedback while running?",
    options: [
      "Topic (Publisher/Subscriber)",
      "Service (Client/Server)",
      "Action (Goal/Feedback/Result)",
      "Parameter"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 2
  },
  {
    question: "Module 1: In the TF2 tree, what is the standard parent frame for 'base_link' in a mobile robot configuration?",
    options: [
      "map",
      "odom",
      "lidar_link",
      "world"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1
  },
  {
    question: "Module 2: Why do we use the SDF format instead of URDF in Gazebo?",
    options: [
      "SDF is easier to write",
      "URDF is deprecated",
      "URDF describes a single robot tree, while SDF describes the entire world (lights, physics, scene graphs) and handles closed kinematic loops",
      "SDF allows for Python scripting"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 2
  },
  {
    question: "Module 2: Which sensor simulation parameter is critical to prevent the 'Sim-to-Real' gap regarding sensor accuracy?",
    options: [
      "Update Rate",
      "Visual Color",
      "Gaussian Noise (Mean/StdDev)",
      "Topic Name"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 2
  },
  {
    question: "Module 3: What is the primary architectural advantage of NVIDIA Isaac Sim over traditional CPU-based simulators?",
    options: [
      "It uses PhysX 5 on the GPU to simulate thousands of environments in parallel",
      "It runs on Macbooks",
      "It uses Java instead of C++",
      "It has a better text editor"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 0
  },
  {
    question: "Module 3: In the Context of VSLAM, why does the system fail in a completely white, featureless room?",
    options: [
      "The camera is blinded by brightness",
      "VSLAM relies on tracking visual features (corners, edges) to calculate movement; without them, it cannot estimate odometry",
      "The IMU interferes with the white color",
      "The Lidar range is reduced"

    correctAnswer: 1
  },
  {

      "Using a supercomputer",
      "Skipping the physics calculations"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1
  },
  {
    question: "Module 4: What is the role of 'Grounding' in a VLA (Vision-Language-Action) pipeline?",
    options: [
      "Connecting the robot to electrical earth",
      "Forcing the robot to sit down",
      "Mapping abstract concepts from the LLM (e.g., word 'Apple') to specific real-world data (e.g., Bounding Box ID 402 at x=0.5m)",

      "Whisper",
      "Nav2"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1
  },
  {
    question: "Capstone: If you ask an LLM to 'Make a Sandwich' and it outputs a command 'spread_jam()' which your robot does not have code for, what is this called?",
    options: [
      "Creativity",
      "Hallucination",
