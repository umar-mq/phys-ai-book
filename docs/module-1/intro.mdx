# Introduction to Physical AI

Welcome to the first module. This content adapts to your selected experience level using the toolbar above.

### The Simple Explanation

Physical AI is like giving a robot a brain that understands the real world. 
Imagine a robot that doesn't just follow pre-programmed instructions but actually *feels* and *reacts* to its environment, much like a human does.

**Key Concepts:**
*   **Sensors:** The robot's eyes and ears.
*   **Actuators:** The robot's muscles.
*   **Brain:** The AI model that connects them.

### The Technical Deep Dive

Physical Artificial Intelligence (PAI) refers to the synthesis of AI algorithms with physical hardware systems, emphasizing the co-design of morphology and control. Unlike traditional robotics, where control logic is often hard-coded or based on rigid models, PAI leverages learning-based approaches (Reinforcement Learning, Neural Networks) to handle unstructured environments.

**Mathematical Foundation:**
We often model the agent-environment interaction as a Markov Decision Process (MDP):
$$
(S, A, P, R, \gamma)
$$
Where:
*   $S$: State space (sensor readings)
*   $A$: Action space (motor torques)
*   $P$: Transition probability distribution
*   $R$: Reward function
